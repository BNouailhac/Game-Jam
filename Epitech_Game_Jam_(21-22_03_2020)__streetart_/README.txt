Here is the result of the Epitech Game Jam made between the 21/03 and the 22/03 2020, 
the theme was "streetart".

We were 5 students to make this game and we decided to make a Beat 'em up video game playable on Windows.
The game have an 5 minute playtime and is only in french. my work on this project was to handle the player gameplay.

to launch the game execute "Les hommes du tableaux.exe"
